Problem Statement
The problem statement for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 

The data set is taken from the Kaggle website and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent. Since the data set is highly imbalanced, it needs to be handled before model building.
